# cs355-project

# Running project:
- Navigate to project directory (git should open there automatically)
- open terminal and run 'python main.py'
- enter 'Alice' (in order to start server)
- open a new terminal window and run 'python main.py' again
- this time enter 'Bob' (to start client)


# status:

  I have successfully tested the connection between Alice (server) and Bob (client).
  I have also tested that Alice and Bob are successfully sharing their generated shared keys.
  I left the print statements in so you guys should be able to see when running the project. [js]
